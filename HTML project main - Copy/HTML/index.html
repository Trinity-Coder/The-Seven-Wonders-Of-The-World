<h1> The 7 Wonders Of The World</h1>
<p>These are beautiful structures and are absolute works of art. These aren't the classic (or the ancient) seven wonders of the world but as far as iconic architectural marvels go, these rank right amongst the most symbolic edifices of their times. Significantly these seven structures continue to draw visitors by droves, and their significance was formally recognised when they were officially voted as the "New 7 Wonders Of The World", a few years back.</p>
