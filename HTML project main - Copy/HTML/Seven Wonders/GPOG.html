The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of<BR>the pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven<BR>Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.<BR><BR>

Egyptologists conclude that the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and estimate<BR>that it was built in the 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years.<BR><BR>

Initially standing at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than<BR>3,800 years. Throughout history the majority of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the<BR>pyramid's height to the present 138.5 metres (454.4 ft). What is seen today is the underlying core structure. The base was<BR>measured to be about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic<BR>feet), which includes an internal hillock.<BR><BR>

The dimensions of the pyramid were 280 royal cubits (146.7 m; 481.4 ft) high, a base length of 440 cubits (230.6 m;<BR>756.4 ft), with a seked of 5.5
 palms (a slope of 51Â°50'40").<BR><BR>

The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks weighing 6 million tonnes total. The majority<BR>of stones are not uniform in size or shape and are only roughly dressed. The outside layers were bound together by<BR>mortar. Primarily local limestone from the Giza Plateau was used. Other blocks were imported by boat down the Nile: White<BR>limestone from Tura for the casing, and granite blocks from Aswan, weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the King's Chamber<BR>structure.<BR><BR>

There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest was cut into the bedrock, upon which the pyramid<BR>was built, but remained unfinished. The so-called Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber, that contains a granite<BR>sarcophagus, are higher up, within the pyramid structure. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon), is believed by some<BR>to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. Many varying scientific and alternative hypotheses attempt to explain the exact<BR>construction techniques.<BR><BR>
