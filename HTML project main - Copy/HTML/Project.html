The New 7 Wonders of the World was a campaign started in 2000 to choose Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing <BR> monuments.The popularity poll via free Web-based voting and small amounts of telephone voting was led by Canadian-Swiss <BR> Bernard Weber and organized by the New 7 Wonders Foundation (N7W) based in Zurich, Switzerland, with winners announced on <BR> 7 July 2007 in Lisbon, at Estádio da Luz. The poll was considered unscientific partly because it was possible for people to <BR> cast multiple votes. According to John Zogby, founder and current President/CEO of the Utica, New York-based polling <BR> organization Zogby International, New 7 Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on record".<BR><BR>The program drew a wide range of official reactions. Some countries touted their finalist and tried to get more votes cast for it, while <BR> others downplayed or criticized the contest. After supporting the New 7 Wonders Foundation at the beginning of the campaign <BR> by providing advice on nominee selection, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), by its <BR> bylaws having to record all and give equal status to world heritage sites, distanced itself from the undertaking in 2001 and again in 2007.<BR><BR>The seven winners were chosen from 21 candidates, which had been whittled down from 77 choices by a panel in 2006.<BR><BR>The New 7 Wonders Foundation, established in 2001, relied on private donations and the sale of broadcast rights and received no <BR> public funding. After the final announcement, New 7 Wonders said it did not earn anything from the exercise and barely recovered <BR> its investment. Although N7W describes itself as a not-for-profit organization, the company behind it—the New Open World <BR> Corporation (NOWC)—is a commercial business. All licensing and sponsorship money is paid to NOWC.<BR><BR>The foundation ran two subsequent programs: New 7 Wonders of Nature, the subject of voting until 2011, and New7Wonders Cities, <BR> which ended in 2014.<BR><BR>The campaigns and the organization are sometimes spelled as one word and sometimes as a single word.
