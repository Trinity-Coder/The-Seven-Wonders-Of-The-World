        <h5>A Wonder of the World</h5>
        <p>This wonder of the world is the most valuable treasure in Jordan, and also its main tourist attraction in the country.A unique city sculpted on the rocks by the Nebauteus, the Arabic people who once lived in the Jordan deserts around Petra, a place that became a very important mark of the Silk route and other goods that were transported between Saudi Arabia, China, Greece, Egypt, Syria, and Rome.Petra and as the Nabateans used to call it “Raqmu” is one of the most famous cities in Jordan due to its archaeological and architectural history. The city is also known as the Rose City due to its pink rocks formations.Petra was established in 312 AC, and it became the capital of the Nabateans people, who were referred to in the Bible. They inhabited the region of Petra between the IV AC and II DC. Petra was also a very important commercial center between the Arabic peninsula and Damascus in Syria, and today Petra is the most visited tourist attraction in Jordan.The Romans conquered Petra in 106 A.C, and they turned the territory into a roman province. During the second and third centuries, Petra continued to grow and in the seventh century, the Romans lost the power of Petra to Islam.In the 12th century, Petra was once again taken by different leaders and for a while, Petra was hidden until it was found by Swiss explores Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, who was responsible to announce the city into the world with his poem “a rose-red city half as old as time.” In 2007, Petra was recognized as one of the Seven Wonders of the World and UNESCO described the city as “one of the most precious properties of the cultural inheritance of mankind.” Petra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.</p>

        <h5>Geography of the site</h5>
        <p>Petra grew in importance chiefly through the ability of the Nabatean people in catching and storing the rain water which fell consistently in the area when floods occurred. One can also find an oasis which was purposely built in the city and this made it increase in importance when there were periods of drought since water was sold as a commodity. The Nabateans also created an extremely complex system of cisterns and wells to store this water which has remained largely intact and which can be viewed to this day.</p>
        <h5>Rock cut dwellings in Petra</h5>
        <p>In ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south through the track that leads across the plain of Petra where there are two other important archeological sites such as the Tomb of Aron. However the site is now generally approached from the East. There is a gargantuan and hugely impressive entrance which then leads down to a steeply elevated narrow gorge which only four metres wide in some areas. This gorge has been called the ‘Siq’ which means shaft and is actually a natural geological feature which is formed through a split in the rocks made of sandstone and which serves in itself as a waterway that eventually flows into the Wadi Musa. At the end of this narrow gorge one finds possibly the most elaborate and most stunning architectural building of the city which is the ruin of Al Khazneh (also known as ‘The Treasury’) This impressive and awe inspiring building is actually hewn into the sandstone cliff. Although it is still in remarkably well preserved condition, the face of it is riddled with bullet holes which were made by the Bedouin tribes who hoped to dislodge some of the riches which were rumoured to be found in it but which had long since disappeared.</p>

          <h5>Architectural design</h5>
          <p>The city of Petra is an awe inspiring series of structures which concentrate primarily on the rock cut tombs. Since the tombs are hewn directly into the rock the labour must have been painstaking and done by hand as the workers would be chipping away at the rock for days and weeks on end. The great structures such as the amphitheatres were undoubtedly built by large teams of people who would work together in groups building the impressive edifice like structures. The pinkish coloured stone lent itself to carving and chiselling quite well and this means that the design was strikingly forward looking for its day. One may compare the amphitheatre and the Treasury to some of the structures from the Egyptian period such as the Abu Simbel Temple and the temples of Karnak.There is not much evidence to prove that the architects which worked on the city of Petra had the same vision for the area. However when one examines the incredibly advanced designs for water catchment one notes that everything here was carried out with a thought in mind, that of conserving water as much as possible for eventual resale. This led the engineers to design a complicated and ingenious system of cisterns and culverts where the water flows along upon various levels. The engineering feat is quite remarkable since there is very little evidence on how it was actually planned and how it came to be created.The main freestanding and rock cut monuments lie within the area that is now an archaeological park. Since it was built, it has suffered extensively from weather pressures as well as tourism pressures. Although most of the buildings remain, the real jewel of the whole area is the series of tombs which are cut into the rock.</p>
